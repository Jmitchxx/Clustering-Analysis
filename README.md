Wholesale Customer Segmentation

This is a data science project aimed at analyzing a dataset containing information on various customers' annual spending amounts of diverse product categories. The project's main goal is to identify patterns and structures within the data to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insights into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

Project Description

The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using machine learning techniques. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics such as behavior, needs, or demographics. By segmenting customers, the wholesale distributor can tailor their delivery service to meet the specific needs of each group, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Data Source

The dataset used for this project is publicly available and can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories, including fresh produce, milk, grocery, frozen, detergents, and paper products.

Data Preprocessing

Before performing data analysis, we will preprocess the dataset to ensure that it is suitable for machine learning techniques. Preprocessing will include handling missing values, normalizing the data, and feature scaling.

Data Analysis

We will perform customer segmentation using various machine learning algorithms, including clustering algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clustering. We will also use dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the data and identify patterns.

Results

After performing data analysis, we will present the findings and insights gained from the customer segmentation process. We will use various visualization techniques to present the results in a clear and concise manner.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this data science project focused on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques has helped us identify patterns and structures within the dataset. By segmenting customers based on their spending behavior, the wholesale distributor can tailor their delivery service to meet the specific needs of each group. This will improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately leading to a more successful business.
